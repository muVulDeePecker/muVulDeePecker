 * @description
 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: rand Set data to result of rand(), which may be zero
 * GoodSource: Assign count to be a relatively small number
 * Sinks: fwrite
 *    GoodSink: Write to a file count number of times, but first validate count
 *    BadSink : Write to a file count number of times
 * Flow Variant: 84 Data flow: data passed to class constructor and destructor by declaring the class object on the heap and deleting it after use

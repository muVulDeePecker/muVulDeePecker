 * CWE: 122 Heap Based Buffer Overflow
 * BadSource:  Allocate using new[] and set data pointer to a small buffer
 * GoodSource: Allocate using new[] and set data pointer to a large buffer
 * Sink: memcpy
 *    BadSink : Copy int array to data using memcpy
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a global variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.

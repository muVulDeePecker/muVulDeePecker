 *
 * phase: release phase to execute
 * isCommit: true for successful completion of a query or transaction,
 *			false for unsuccessful
 * isTopLevel: true if completing a main transaction, else false
 *

 * If so it is reasonable to give a warning (NOT an error) should any
 * unreleased resources be present.  When isCommit is false, such warnings
 * are generally inappropriate.
 *
 * isTopLevel is passed when we are releasing TopTransactionResourceOwner
 * at completion of a main transaction.  This generally means that *all*
